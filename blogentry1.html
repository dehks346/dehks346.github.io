            I believe that everything should be questioned because if we don’t question everything how we will understand anything, without curiosity nobody would have the ambition to discover. Evolution made curiosity an imperative to our survival, from our humble beginnings as primitive hunter gatherers we needed curiosity to thrive in our environments in order to understand how to hunt, develop, and improve Without this primitive drive to understand we wouldn’t be here today; we’d be yet another species that couldn’t adapt and became extinct.
